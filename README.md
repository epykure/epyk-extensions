# Create an extension for Epyk


As Epyk is a collaborative project, it is possible to create your own extensions based on your favorite Javascript modules.
This will show you how to create, share and publish your packages to PYPI.

The naming convention for epyk extensions is epyk_x_%packageName%

Each package name is saved in this repository as a folder.

For example js_datepicker
